# Definitions

* 0-Spike  
Consecutive part in a (trigger) signal where all elements are 0.

* 1-Spike  
Consecutive part in a (trigger) signal where all elements are 1.

* Ripple  
Elements of value 0 in a part of a signal that could be a 1-spike if it was not for these few 0 valued elements.

* Trigger Points  
Positions in a Signal where QRS complexes are.

* Trigger Signal  
An intermediate representation in the task of finding QRS complexes. This is a signal with approximately the same length as the ECG signal showing where a detector has found a QRS complex. From this signal we can generate trigger points.
